I am Root. We are Root.
I am Spartacus
I am even stupider than I thought
I am sorry
I can't believe it took so long to fix this.
I cannot believe that it took this long to write a test for this.
I did it for the lulz!
I don't believe it
I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
I don't know what these changes are supposed to accomplish but somebody told me to make them.
I don't know why. Just move on.
I expected something different.
I forgot to commit... So here you go.
I had a cup of tea and now it's fixed
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
I honestly wish I could remember what was going on here...
I know what I am doing. Trust me.
I know, I know, this is not how I’m supposed to do it, but I can't think of something better.

I must have been drunk.
I must sleep... it's working... in just three hours...
I really should've committed this when I finished it...
I should get a raise for this.
I should have had a V8 this morning.
I was told to leave it alone, but I have this thing called OCD, you see
I was wrong...
I would rather be playing SC2.
I'M PUSHING.
I'll explain this when I'm sober .. or revert it
I'll explain when you're older!

If it's hacky and you know it clap you hands (clap clap)!
Is there an achievement for this?
Is there an award for this?
Issue #{{ .NumL }} is now Issue #{{ .NumM }}
It compiles! Ship it!
It only compiles every {{ .NumL }} tries... good luck.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
It worked for me...
It works!
It'd be nice if type errors caused the compiler to issue a type error

That last commit message about silly mistakes pales in comparision to this one
That's just how I roll
The last time I tried this the monkey didn't survive. Let's hope it works better this time.
The same thing we do every night, Pinky - try to take over the world!
Things went wrong...
This branch is so dirty, even your mom can't clean it.
This bunny should be killed.
This commit is a lie
This is a basic implementation that works.
This is not the commit message you are looking for
This is supposed to crash
This is the last time we let {{ .Fname }} commit ascii art in the comments.
This is where it all begins...
This is why git rebase is a horrible horrible thing.
This is why the cat shouldn't sit on my keyboard.
This really should not take 19 minutes to build.
This solves it.
This will definitely break in 20{{ .NumH }} (TODO)
To be honest, I do not quite remember everything I changed here today. But it is all good, I tell ya.
To those I leave behind, good luck!
Todo!!!
Too lazy to write descriptive message
Too tired to write descriptive message
Trust me, it's not badly written. It's just way above your head.

Who Let the Bugs Out??
Who has two thumbs and remembers the rudiments of his linear algebra courses?  Apparently, this guy.
Who knows WTF?!
Who knows...
Working on tests (haha)
Yep, {{ .Fname }} was right on this one.
Yes, I was being sarcastic.
You can't see it, but I'm making a very angry face right now
You should have trusted me.
Your commit is writing checks your merge can't cash.
